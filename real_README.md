# **Generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) implementation**

In mathematics, the **generalized minimal residual method (GMRES)** is an iterative method for the numerical solution of an **indefinite non-symmetric** system of linear equations. <br>
The method approximates the solution by the vector in a [**Krylov subspace**](krilov link) with minimal residual. The **Arnoldi iteration** is used to find this vector.

In linear algebra, the order-`r` **Krylov subspace** generated by an **n-by-n matrix** A and a vector b of dimension `n` is the linear subspace spanned by the images of b under the first r powers of A (starting from ${\displaystyle A^{0}=I}A^{0}=I)$, that is, 

$$
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}_{r}(A,b)=\operatorname {span} \,\{b,Ab,A^{2}b,\ldots ,A^{r-1}b\}.}
$$

The GMRES method was developed by Yousef Saad and Martin H. Schultz in 1986.[1] It is a generalization and improvement of the MINRES method due to Paige and Saunders in 1975.[2][3] The MINRES method requires that the matrix is symmetric, but has the advantage that it only requires handling of three vectors. GMRES is a special case of the DIIS method developed by Peter Pulay in 1980. DIIS is applicable to non-linear systems.
