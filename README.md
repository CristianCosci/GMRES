## **Introduction**

In mathematics, the **generalized minimal residual method (GMRES)** is an iterative method for the numerical solution of an **indefinite non-symmetric** system of linear equations. <br>
The method approximates the solution by the vector in a [**Krylov subspace**](#krylov-subspace) with minimal residual. The **Arnoldi iteration** is used to find this vector.

#### **Krylov Subspace**

In linear algebra, the order-`r` **Krylov subspace** generated by an **n-by-n matrix** A and a vector b of dimension `n` is the linear subspace spanned by the images of b under the first r powers of A (starting from $A^{0}=I$ ), that is,

$$
\mathcal{K}_{r}(A,b) = \operatorname{span} \lbrace b,Ab,A^{2} b, \ldots , A^{r-1}b \rbrace .
$$

Modern iterative methods such as **Arnoldi iteration** can be used for finding one (or a few) eigenvalues of large **sparse matrices** or solving large systems of linear equations. They try to avoid matrix-matrix operations, but rather multiply vectors by the matrix and work with the resulting vectors. Starting with a vector ${\displaystyle b}$, one computes ${\displaystyle Ab}$, then one multiplies that vector by ${\displaystyle A}$ to find ${\displaystyle A^{2}b}$ and so on. All algorithms that work this way are referred to as Krylov subspace methods; they are among the most successful methods currently available in numerical linear algebra.

#### **Arnoldi Iteration**

In numerical linear algebra, the **Arnoldi iteration** is an eigenvalue algorithm and an important example of an iterative method. Arnoldi finds an approximation to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general (possibly non-Hermitian) matrices by constructing an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace, which makes it particularly useful when dealing with large sparse matrices.

The Arnoldi method belongs to a class of linear algebra algorithms that give a partial result after a small number of iterations, in contrast to so-called direct methods which must complete to give any useful results (see for example, Householder transformation). The partial result in this case being the first few vectors of the basis the algorithm is building.

#### **Power Iteration**

The power iteration algorithm starts with a vector,

$$
b_{k+1} =  \frac{Ab_k}{\parallel Ab_k  \parallel}   .
$$

which may be an approximation to the dominant eigenvector or a random vector. The method is described by the recurrence relation
